## IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Repository for a classification model using Space X's Falcon 9 Data.
This is the final project required to finish and obtain the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
This project involved scraping through SpaceX data and developing a model that can correctly predict whether a Falcon 9 will land successfully after deployment or not.
The project involved scraping through SpaceX data and filtering it out to obtain data solely for the Falcon 9 mpdel.
After this exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization was carried out to gain some insights for the data and prepare it for modelling.
The data underwent preprocessing in order to standardize features and one-hot encoding was applied to categorical columns in order to standardize them into numerical format.
From here on the data was split into the training set and testing set with the split being between the dataset's features and the target varIable.
After splitting the data was trained under 3 classification model systems: Logistic Regression, tree classification and support vector machines (SVMs).
